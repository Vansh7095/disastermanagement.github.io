## 🌐 DisasterShield – AI-Powered Disaster Management System

**Website:** [https://vansh7095.github.io/disastershield.github.io](https://vansh7095.github.io/disastershield.github.io)

DisasterShield is a full-fledged, AI-integrated, DIY disaster management system designed to detect, predict, and respond to natural disasters using **real-time sensors**, **AI models**, and a **custom-built website** interface.

---

### 📌 Features

* ✅ Real-time disaster monitoring using ESP32 and sensors
* 🤖 AI-based decision-making to predict and prevent 99% of disasters
* 🌍 Interactive multi-page website with live data visualization
* 📈 Data synced between ESP32, display, and website
* ♻️ Eco-friendly, low-cost, and fully open-source
* 🧠 Educational and scalable – perfect for school science exhibitions

---

### 🧠 What It Can Detect

* Floods (using ultrasonic or water level sensors)
* Fires (using flame and temperature sensors)
* Earthquakes (using vibration/tilt sensors)
* Gas leaks (using MQ sensors)
* Landslides (soil moisture and rain sensors)
* Custom alerts for any emergency conditions

---

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Hardware:**

   * ESP32 microcontroller
   * Connected sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, DHT11, MQ135, IR, etc.)
   * OLED or LCD for local display

2. **Website Interface:**

   * Live updates from ESP32 shown on the homepage
   * Separate pages: Home, About Creator, Contact, Instructions
   * AI prediction integrated in backend (future integration with Firebase or Python Flask)

3. **Communication:**

   * Data can be sent from ESP32 using Firebase or WebSocket
   * Displayed both on physical screen and web dashboard
